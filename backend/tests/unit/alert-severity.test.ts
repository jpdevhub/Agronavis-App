 * Every advisory is stored as a notification and listed in the app. Severity
 * decides only which ones also light up the handset: the service pushes
 * critical and high and marks the rest `skipped`.
 *
 * The line matters in both directions. Push too little and the warning that
 * mattered is missed; push everything and notifications get turned off, which
 * loses the same warning by a different route. These pin where each advisory
 * sits so a future edit to the wording cannot quietly move one across it.
