/**
 * Rate limits, tiered by what a request actually costs us.
 *
 * One global ceiling is the wrong shape for this API. Listing a farmer's
 * fields is a single indexed read; diagnosing a leaf photograph is ONNX
 * inference on a 512 MB instance, and a handful at once is enough to exhaust
 * it. A budget generous enough for the first is dangerous for the second.
 *
 * ── Why these are keyed by farmer, not by address ───────────────────────
 * Most Indian mobile traffic arrives through carrier-grade NAT: Jio and Airtel
 * put very large numbers of subscribers behind a small pool of public
 * addresses. An IP-keyed limit therefore does not throttle a user, it
 * throttles a district — one person refreshing hard could lock out every
 * farmer sharing that exit. Signed-in requests are keyed by farmer id, which
 * is the thing we actually want to limit. Only unauthenticated traffic falls
 * back to the address, where there is nothing better to use.
 */

/**
 * An address reduced to the thing worth counting.
 *
 * IPv4 is used whole. IPv6 is cut to its /64 prefix, because a single
 * subscriber is routinely handed an entire /64 — counting full addresses would
 * let them walk through their own prefix and draw a fresh budget each time.
 * express-rate-limit's own helper does this, but it is not exported in the
 * version pinned here.
